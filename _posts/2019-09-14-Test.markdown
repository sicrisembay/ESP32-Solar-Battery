This is a test blog entry as I am learning on how to create and maintain a blog page for this project.  The plan is to
post a weekly update on this project and at the same time, I will try to fix bugs on this blog page (i.e. I can't
figure out why the nav bar is not behaving as expected).

I am very new to this but there are tons of information in the web that really help me to jump start this blog page.

Some of the websites that I found very useful:
* [Setting up a Jekyll blog on Github Pages](https://michelleful.github.io/code-blog/2014/02/28/setting-up-a-jekyll-blog-on-github-pages/)
* [startbootstrap-clean-blog](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog)
